# The Programmming Language Café
Originally developed as a college work, Café is a small programming language that compiles into Lua. Café has a simple and very good syntax to learn the fundamentals of structured programming.

## Running the project (Linux only)
1. Download the Lua compiler [HERE](https://www.lua.org/download.html).
2. Download the latest version of this project [HERE](https://github.com/valmirt/Compilador-em-lua/releases/latest).
3. Write any code following the syntax rules described [HERE](https://github.com/valmirt/Programming-language-cafe/wiki) and name the file as font.cafe
4. Save this created file into the project folder.
5. Open the terminal in the folder where the project is located.
6. Run: `lua compiler.lua`
7. All ready! A file named program.c is created and can be run in the c language compiler.
